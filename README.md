## 1. Getting started:
- Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length and avoid obstacles.
- This game uses parallel TCP/IP socket server with multithreading and multiprocessing in C together with other Unix/Linux kernel data structures and therefore only functions properly on terminals in a Unix environment.
- This game uses *ncurses* to display game console - a programming library providing an application programming interface (API) that allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner.

## 2. Requirement:
- If ncurses is present, the output should produce two lines with the tag [installed] at the end. If no output is produced, then ncurses is not present and you need to install it by running:
```
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
```
- Because it is a game console, only *ncurses* package is needed to run the game. Gcc conpile, socket libraries are available on ubuntu.

## 3. Usage:
- *nguoidung.txt:* file containing user information: username, password, played-time, won-times, ...
> â‡’ In this project I do not use the database to store information, you can integrate database into this project to to store information.
- before run makefile you can edit port to suit your computer which use to run socket/client:
```
server.c: line 13: #define PORT 5500
client.c: line 20: #define PORT 5500

```
*Here I am setting port 5500*
- Run *makefile* and enjoy the game:
```
On server run: ./server
On clients run: ./client (ip of server)
```
> For example, if you run the server and client on the same computer, the ip might be 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, get the *IPv4 address* of the server to connect server.
